The API allows you to maintain yours databases.

## Getting Started

I assumed you know about [REST API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). But if you don't know, don't worry about because I give you examples using `curl` or you can access api using your web browser too. There is a beautiful interface to help you to understand it.

To ensure you will be able to run all examples, they are based on sample data provided by `make reset_data` command.

Currently, only basic authentication is supported. So I recommend you use HTTPS.

## Database
This resource represents a database. Databases can be created on different engines.

| Fields | Description | Required? | Read only? |
| ---- |:-------------| -----:| -----:|
| id    | Unique identifier of your database | yes (but is automatic) | yes |
| name  | Name of database. | yes | no* |
| plan  | Which kind of plan your database is using | yes | no* |
| environment  | On which environment your database was created | yes | no* |
| project  | Project related with this database | no | no |
| quarantine_dt  | Date on which your database enter on quarantine | no | no |
| endpoint | Connection address for this database | no | yes |
| total_size_in_bytes  | Total size of your database. Depends of you plan | no | yes |
| used_size_in_bytes  | Used space of your database (this is not a realtime information) | no | yes |
| credentials  | List of credentials that have access to this database | no | yes |
\* This fields are not read only at creation time, but you can change it after.

### POST /api/database/
Create new database. Required fields are:

* name
* plan
* environment
* project, not required, but can be specified at creation time.


In response, you will have the id and endpoint of your new database. By default, a new user with name 'u_name of database' will be created for this database.
