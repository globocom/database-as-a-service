Database as a Service (DBaaS)
===================================

Introduction
============

This is an implementation of a database as a service api written in python + django. It will try to follow some hypermedia concepts throughout the api calls.

Requirements
============

DBaaS requires the following:

* python >= 2.7.5
* virtualenv >= 1.7.2
* virtualenvwrapper >= 3.5
* mysql server and client, version 5.5.x
* mongo client = 2.4 (used by the clone feature)
* redis (broker for async tasks with celery)
* and all packages in requirements.txt file (there is a shortcut to install them)


Setup docker and docker-compose(optional)
=========================================

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Setup your local environment
============================

    mkvirtualenv dbaas
    workon dbaas


Install the required python packages.

    make pip
    
Run migrations to mysql database

    make run_migrate

Install redis and start celery

    make run_celery

Create the tables structure (see the next item)

## DB

DBaaS uses south to maintain the migrations up-to-date. However, you can
just run syncdb to create the table structures. There is a shortcut to help you with that, including
some minimum operational data on DB.

    make reset_data

## Running all tests on local enviroment

    make pip && make test

## Running all test with docker( To run this the and docker-compose must be avaliable)

    make docker_build && make test_with_docker

## Running the project

    make run

In your browser open the URL: http://localhost:8000/admin/

### Running celery

To run celery locally use the following command

    cd {APP DIR}
    make run_celery
